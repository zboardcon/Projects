Stuff i do

I'm coding all day and I'm feeling so fly,
Committing to GitHub, reaching for the sky.
Pushing my changes, with each line refined,
Version control keeps my code in line.

Branching out, trying new things with delight,
Collaboration's sweet, it's outta sight.
So remember, my friend, as you code away,
Commit to GitHub and let your skills sway!
